The magazine is produced by The Little Black Gallery, a U.K.-based online gallery that represents more than 60 photographers globally. The gallery also publishes books and organizes exhibitions under the BOYS! BOYS! BOYS! brand, which aims to make queer and gay photography more visible and mainstream in the fine art world and the media.
 
The first issue of The Male Form was released in January 2021 and features stunning portraits, nudes, and landscapes that celebrate the male body in all its shapes, colors, and expressions. The magazine also supports the LGBTQ+ community and the fight against HIV by donating $1 of every sale to charity.
 
The Male Form is available for purchase from [www.boysboysboys.org](https://www.boysboysboys.org) as well as select newsagents and bookstores. It is a must-have for anyone who appreciates the art and beauty of queer and gay photography.

Some of the photographers featured in the first issue of The Male Form are Matt Lambert, Florian Hetz, Spyros Rennt, Domenico Cennamo, and Melody Melamed. Their works range from intimate portraits and erotic scenes to conceptual collages and documentary projects. They explore themes such as identity, desire, intimacy, vulnerability, and resistance in their images.
 
Queer and gay photography is not a new phenomenon, but it has gained more visibility and recognition in recent years thanks to social media and online platforms. Queer and gay photographers use their cameras as tools of expression, empowerment, and activism. They challenge the norms and stereotypes of masculinity and sexuality in their images and create diverse and inclusive representations of the LGBTQ+ community.
 
However, queer and gay photography also faces many challenges and barriers in the mainstream media and the fine art world. Many queer and gay photographers still face discrimination, censorship, and violence in certain countries and communities. Their works are often marginalized, ignored, or appropriated by the dominant culture. Queer and gay photography also has to deal with the legacy of colonialism, racism, sexism, and homophobia that have shaped the history and perception of sexuality.
 
The Male Form is a magazine that aims to celebrate and support queer and gay photography in all its forms and expressions. It showcases the work of talented photographers from different backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. It also creates a space for dialogue, education, and inspiration for anyone who appreciates the art and beauty of queer and gay photography.
